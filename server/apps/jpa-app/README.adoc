= Guice-JPA Server How-to

This server target single node James deployments. By default, the derby database is used.

== Requirements

 * Java 11 SDK

== Running

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

James requires the configuration to be in a subfolder of working directory that is called
**conf**. A [sample directory](https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/container/guice/jpa-guice/sample-configuration)
is provided with some default values you may need to replace. You will need to update its content to match your needs.

You also need to generate a keystore with the following command:

[source]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with:

[source]
----
$ java -javaagent:james-server-jpa-guice.lib/openjpa-3.1.2.jar -Dworking.directory=. -Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.xml -jar james-server-jpa-app.jar
----

Note that binding ports below 1024 requires administrative rights.

== Docker distribution

To import the image locally:

[source]
----
docker image load -i target/jib-image.tar
----

Then run it:

[source]
----
docker run apache/james:jpa-latest
----

Use the [JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment option](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/faq.md#jvm-flags)
to pass extra JVM flags. For instance:

[source]
----
docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xmx500m -Xms500m" apache/james:jpa-latest
----

For security reasons you are required to generate your own keystore, that you can mount into the container via a volume:

[source]
----
keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore
docker run -v $PWD/keystore:/root/conf/keystore docker run apache/james:jpa-latest
----

[Glowroot APM](https://glowroot.org/) is packaged as part of the docker distribution to easily enable valuable performances insights.
Disabled by default, its java agent can easily be enabled:


[source]
----
docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/root/glowroot.jar" apache/james:jpa-latest
----

The [CLI](https://james.apache.org/server/manage-cli.html) can easily be used:


[source]
----
docker exec CONTAINER-ID james-cli ListDomains
----
