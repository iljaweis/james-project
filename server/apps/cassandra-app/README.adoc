= Cassandra Guice Server How-to

*WARNING*: This server only targets single James node deployment on top of a shared database.

It do not target deployments with multiple James nodes as is misses inter-node communication capabilities.

*WARNING*: JAMES-3591 Cassandra is not made to store large binary content, its use will be suboptimal compared to
alternatives (namely S3 compatible BlobStores backed by for instance S3, MinIO or Ozone)

== Requirements

 * Java 11 SDK

Third party compulsory dependencies:

 * Cassandra 3.11.10
 * ElasticSearch 7.10.2

[source]
----
$ docker run -d -p 9042:9042 --name=cassandra cassandra:3.11.10
$ docker run -d -p 9200:9200 --name=elasticsearch --env 'discovery.type=single-node' docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2
----

== Running

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

James requires the configuration to be in a subfolder of working directory that is called
**conf**. A [sample directory](https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/apps/cassandra-app/sample-configuration)
is provided with some default values you may need to replace, especially compulsory third party software endpoints.

You will need to update its content to match your needs.

You also need to generate a keystore with the following command:

[source]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with:

[source]
----
$ java -Dworking.directory=. -Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.xml -jar james-server-cassandra-app.jar
----

Note that binding ports below 1024 requires administrative rights.

== Docker distribution

To import the image locally:

[source]
----
docker image load -i target/jib-image.tar
----

Then run it:

[source]
----
docker run apache/james:cassandra-latest
----

For security reasons you are required to generate your own keystore, that you can mount into the container via a volume:

[source]
----
keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore
docker run -v $PWD/keystore:/root/conf/keystore docker run apache/james:cassandra-latest
----

Use the [JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment option](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/docs/faq.md#jvm-flags)
to pass extra JVM flags. For instance:

[source]
----
docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xmx500m -Xms500m" apache/james:cassandra-latest
----

[Glowroot APM](https://glowroot.org/) is packaged as part of the docker distribution to easily enable valuable performances insights.
Disabled by default, its java agent can easily be enabled:


[source]
----
docker run -e "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/root/glowroot.jar" apache/james:cassandra-latest
----

The [CLI](https://james.apache.org/server/manage-cli.html) can easily be used:


[source]
----
docker exec CONTAINER-ID james-cli ListDomains
----
